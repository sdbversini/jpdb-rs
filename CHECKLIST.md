  - [ ] Cargo.toml includes all common metadata ([C-METADATA])
    - authors, description, license, homepage, documentation, repository,
      keywords, categories
  - [ ] Release notes document all significant changes ([C-RELNOTES])
  - [ ] Rustdoc does not show unhelpful implementation details ([C-HIDDEN])
- **Predictability** _(crate enables legible code that acts how it looks)_
  - [ ] Smart pointers do not add inherent methods ([C-SMART-PTR])
  - [ ] Conversions live on the most specific type involved ([C-CONV-SPECIFIC])
  - [ ] Functions with a clear receiver are methods ([C-METHOD])
  - [ ] Functions do not take out-parameters ([C-NO-OUT])
  - [ ] Operator overloads are unsurprising ([C-OVERLOAD])
  - [ ] Only smart pointers implement `Deref` and `DerefMut` ([C-DEREF])
  - [ ] Constructors are static, inherent methods ([C-CTOR])
- **Flexibility** _(crate supports diverse real-world use cases)_
  - [ ] Functions expose intermediate results to avoid duplicate work ([C-INTERMEDIATE])
  - [ ] Caller decides where to copy and place data ([C-CALLER-CONTROL])
  - [ ] Functions minimize assumptions about parameters by using generics ([C-GENERIC])

  - [ ] Destructors never fail ([C-DTOR-FAIL])
  - [ ] Destructors that may block have alternatives ([C-DTOR-BLOCK])
